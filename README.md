# flights_data_visualizations
In this repository, I explore a dataset from 2008 that catalogs US flights and their characteristics. 
I have two separate Jupyter notebooks: one for exploratory and explanatory visualizations.
In my exploratory notebook, I systematically explore univariate, bivariate, and multivariate relationships in the dataset that will illuminate what contributes to a flight being delayed (and to what degree), cancelled, or diverted.
In my explanatory notebook, I create a slide deck to showcase my findings and create polished charts to convey these insights
